# How to improve the visibility of your project

As a library author or maintainer, the visibility of your project on Scaladex is under your control.

As soon as a release is pushed to Maven Central (Sonatype), Scaladex downloads the latest content and metadata from the Github repository. It then uses those metadata to index the project.

You can make it easier for the search engine to index your project by paying attention to the below details:

### Meaningful Github description

A good description is short but meaningful. keep in mind that those words are the first a user will read about your project.

### Precise Github topics

Carefully choosing the topics of your project is the most efficient way to improve your discoverability. You should ask yourself what terms a developer is likely to type when looking for a solution that your library provides. Be precise. If your project is a collection of utilities the term `utils` is not much helpful but `time`, `duration`, `space`, `hashing` are.

### Detailed readme

A detailed readme is helpful but it is not required for good indexing.
